# Console App to Aid the New Youth Soccer Coach

Code in progress to aid my thinking about filling a lineup for a game of 8 year olds.

## Missing Concepts

Rounds: looping the player list in random order the first round.

At some point the order may be that players that did not get their preference go to the top of the round.

If inside the round we find that no more preferred positions are available... what do we do?

Put the player in the next postion down the ranking? 

And what if we get to a point at which the person's least favorite position is not available...

We will have to go back up the ranking.

## Feature Ideas

- Add ability to pick from list of positions and formations for multiple instances of the same position on the pitch or create your own.

- Goalie is added by default for local U8, but need to consider broader use
